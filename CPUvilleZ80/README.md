There are various programs for the CPUVille Z80 board that have been
ported to the asl and z80asm assemblers. The original source for CP/M
must be legally downloaded, which the make file can do.

Note: Tiny Basic was written for the original CPUville Z80 SBC and
will not run on the new model due to memory map differences. Microsoft
or other Basic running on CP/M is probably a better option anyway.

Also included is a quick reference document.
