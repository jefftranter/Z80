This is a Z80 single board computer designed base on Grant Searle's
Minimal Chip Count Z80 Computer (32K version). A few change were made:

- Uses an FTDI USB to serial converter rather than full RS-232 port.
- Full schematic including bypass and filter caps and unused gates.
- Powered by USB (if jumper connected)
- 36 pin expansion header connector
- Power on LED
- PCB was designed
