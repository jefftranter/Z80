       This disk has two Computerized  Fantasy Simulations (2 CFS's) for
       kids;
                    NIT (.BAS) for Nellan is Thirsty and
                    DTC (.BAS) for Deposit the Chair.

       Both need  Microsoft  BASIC  and are stored  in ASCII  form.  The
       associated  .CMT (comment)  files (also in ASCII form) have BASIC
       line numbers so that they can be MERGEd with the main program  if
       you like.

       I don't know how much space the CFS's require.  I think  that NIT
       needs 16 K of RAM above  MBASIC  for storage  and execution.  DTC
       shouldn't  take that  much.  The question  is complicated  by how
       often MBASIC collects its garbage.  If you have 48 K, you have no
       problem; with 40 K you can probably run DTC but not NIT.
       (COMMENT from STAFF: Both NIT.BAS and DTC.BAS need 48K.)

       The July 1980 issue of RECREATIONAL  COMPUTING  has an article on
       writing your own CFS; NIT is given there in a very readable form.
       A followup article is scheduled  for later this year and explains
       DTC. The NIT printout  in "RC" (not given  here since,  with .CMT
       file, it takes 135 sectors) is designed  to show the logic of the
       program; the DTC printout  to be in "RC" is designed  to show how
       little modification  of NIT is required  to produce  a new CFS. I
       call the general framework  of the two CFS's Enchanted  House and
       claim  that  it is easy  to build  a CFS  using  it;  if you  are
       interested, please read the articles and build your own Enchanted
       House using the given framework.

       Please  share the programs  given  on this disk.  If you build  a
       version of Enchanted House, it is yours to sell, swap, give away,
       or hoard.

       Both  NIT and DTC are  intended  for  children  as stated  by Dr.
       Smith, however, "Big Kids" will enjoy using their imaginations to
       complete  their travels through "Nellan is Thirsty"  and "Deposit
       the Chair" versions of the Enchanted House.

       After viewing both CFS's, I offer only two hints. . .

                    1)  "Play" with them, and
                    2)  Use your imagination.

       Have fun "Kids".
