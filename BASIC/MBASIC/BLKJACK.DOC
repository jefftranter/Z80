       The  purpose  of Blackjack  is to provide  an  entertaining
       real-life   simulation   of  casino  blackjack.   The  game
       maintains  in a memory  array,  one to six  decks  of cards
       (user selectable).  One or two players may play against the
       house  (computer)  and may place  bets ranging  from  a two
       dollar  minimum  to a five hundred  dollar  table  maximum,
       although players may "bring" any amount of money they wish.

       During play, players  have three options  - (H)it, (S)tand,
       or (D)ouble.  When a player  recieves  a hit, his cards are
       automatically  totaled and the total is displayed under his
       cards, which are graphically  displayed on the screen. If a
       player busts, control  is passed  to the next player  (in a
       two player game) or to the dealer. The program  counts aces
       as eleven unless the eleven would cause a bust. If a player
       is in a bust  situation  and has only  one ace,  the ace is
       counted  as one;  if he has two  or more,  only  the  least
       number of aces needed to prevent a bust are counted  as one
       (the others are counted as eleven) so as to give the player
       the highest  possible  score. The stand option goes without
       explanation.  Play  is passed  to the  next  player  or the
       dealer.

       The doubling option is available  to a player only when the
       player has two cards in his hand (i.e. before recieving any
       hits). When a player doubles, he receives a hit, his bet is
       doubled,  and play passes to the next player. Note that the
       program  will not allow a player to double  if he lacks the
       money necessary to double his bet.

       Ocasionally  a player gets blackjack.  Blackjack pays three
       to two. The program automatically reshuffles the deck after
       33/52 of the deck has been delt. Depending on the number of
       decks selected,  the number  of turns before  re- shuffling
       will vary. The program identifies  that it is shuffling  by
       printing  "Shuffling"  in the  lower  right  corner  of the
       screen.  At times the computer  will appear to have stopped
       while  it is dealing.  This can occur  at any time however,
       and is caused by Microsoft  Basic's "garbage  collec-  tion
       routine".  The length of the delay depends on the number of
       decks  selected  and is shortest  when  only  one  deck  is
       selected.  Do not confuse this delay with shuffling  as the
       shuffling  routine identifies  itself. The program does not
       allow   splitting   due   to  limitations   in  graphically
       displaying the cards on the screen.

       If a player  runs out of money  during  play,  he is loaned
       some money by the "pit boss". All transactions are recorded
       by the program and at the end of the game (user selects "N"
       to "Another  game?),  the amount  of money  on hand by each
       player, including money on loan is displayed.
