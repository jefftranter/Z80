             HUG P/N 885-1088 MBASIC Games for H19/H8//H89

Microsoft  BASIC (MBASIC) is required for all programs and most programs
have been saved in condensed  form.  If a listing  is desired,  load the
program into memory then output it to your printer  by using the command
SAVE "LP:",A.   Your device  driver  must have been loaded  into  memory
before running MBASIC.

This disk  requires  the use of an H19 (H89)  terminal  for all programs
because of the graphics used by the games.

Do NOT try to use this disk with any other terminal.  HUG will NOT offer
any support to change or allow usage of this disk on any other terminal.

The recommended  minimum  system is 48k of memory however  most programs
will run in much less.

Programs and their authors (with comments from H.U.G.  <TLJ> ):


1)  LUNAR.BAS				A. E. Dessler
					5126 Loch Lomond
					Houston, Tx   77096


This Lunar Lander  game is self documenting.   You will get a tremendous
"kick" out of landing  the "ship" safely.   Please  note that the expert
level  "LEVEL  1" is almost  impossible,  there  is only one way to land
safely at that level.

(Modifications  to the original  program  where made by H.U.G.   GK: and
<TLJ>)


2)  BLKJACK.BAS				Wayne S. Reses
					2 Bayshore Court
					Margate, NJ  08402


Blackjack has its own documention file .  .  .  TYPE SY1:BLKJACK.DOC  to
view the documention  .  .  .  or COPY LP:=SY1:BLKJACK.DOC  to produce a
hard copy.


3)  NIT.BAS				Dr. Furman Smith
    NIT.CMT				University of Houston Victoria Campus
    DTC.BAS				2302-C Red River
    NITDTC.DOC				Victoria, Tx  77901


Please note in the documention file (NITDTC.DOC)  that Dr.  Smith refers
to "RECREATIONAL  COMPUTING".   He has written and prepared an excellent
article  for "RC" which is superbly  documented  to allow the reader  to
create his own fantasy game.












                                                                  PAGE 2 



The HUG STAFF regrets  that we cannot produce  a complete  disk with all
documention  as submitted by Dr.  Smith.  It is in our judgment that his
two Computerized  Fantasy Simulations will reach more users by including
the games and partial documention with this MBASIC Graphic Games Disk.

Dr.  Smith,  we at HEATH  USERS'  GROUP  commend  you  for  an excellent
performance in creating "NELLAN IS THIRSTY" and "DEPOSIT THE CHAIR" with
the intent of teaching others to create their own fantasy game(s).


4)  BOWLING.BAS				David Arnold
    GUESS.BAS				24 Magnet La.
					Willingbord, NJ  08046


The bowling game shows an excellent  display of H19//H89  graphics  with
direct cursor addressing.  Both BOWLING and GUESS can be easily modified
by a beginning MBASIC programmer.

(The BOWLING  game graphics  and direct cursor addressing  were added by
H.U.G.  <TLJ> )


5)  ROBCHAS.BAS				Lyle Wilkinson
    ROBCHAS.DAT				7634 Hollanderry Place
					Cupertino, Ca  95014


You will get a real "charge"  out of the graphics  with  ROBCHASe.   The
documention  is contained  in the data file ROBCHAS.DAT  which is called
into the main program when needed.  (The instruction file is set to read
from "SY1:" ,if you have this disk mounted  on another  drive,  you will
need to change line 2230 from "SY1:ROBCHAS.DAT" to "SY_:ROBCHAS.DAT".)

If you are using  an H8-5 SERIAL  CARD you will need  to change  in line
1250 .  .  .  "C=INP(232)" to "C=INP(250)".

(Slight modifications and adaption to MBASIC were made by H.U.G.  <TLJ>)
