This is a collection of BASIC games that run on the Heathkit H8, H89,
and compatible computers. Most came from David Ahl's 101 BASIC
computer games book. Some have enhancements for the H89/H19 display.

They run under HDOS using Benton Harbor BASIC (BHBASIC) or Microsoft
BASIC-80 (MBASIC).

The code was entered by others, I have just collected them here. Not
all programs are known to be fully working.
